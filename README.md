In this unit students complete the creation of the mechanical and electrotechnological integrated and controlled
system they researched, designed, planned and commenced production of in Unit 3. Students investigate new
and emerging technologies, consider reasons for their development and analyse their impacts.
Students continue producing their mechanical and electrotechnological integrated and controlled system using the
systems engineering process. Students develop their understanding of the open-source model in the development
of integrated and controlled systems, and document its use fairly. They effectively document the use of project and
risk management methods throughout the creation of the system. They use a range of materials, tools, equipment
and components. Students test, diagnose and analyse the performance of the system. They evaluate their process
and the system. Students expand their knowledge of emerging developments and innovations through their investigation and analysis
of a range of engineered systems.
