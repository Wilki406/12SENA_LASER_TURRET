# Systems Engineering Year 12 SAT
## Mechanical Electro-technological Integrated Controlled System
### Study Design Specifications
In this unit students complete the creation of the mechanical and electrotechnological integrated and controlled system they researched, designed, planned and commenced production of in Unit 3. Students investigate new and emerging technologies, consider reasons for their development and analyse their impacts. Students continue producing their mechanical and electrotechnological integrated and controlled system using the systems engineering process. Students develop their understanding of the open-source model in the development of integrated and controlled systems, and document its use fairly. They effectively document the use of project and risk management methods throughout the creation of the system. They use a range of materials, tools, equipment and components. Students test, diagnose and analyse the performance of the system. They evaluate their process and the system. Students expand their knowledge of emerging developments and innovations through their investigation and analysis of a range of engineered systems.

### Overview:
The function of my integrated system is to provide an area denial service that will allow for unauthorized animals to be denied access and moved away from enclosed spaces deemed restricted. The integrated system will be required to be suitable and appealing for users that are not experts in technology and mechanical engineering principles whilst still achieving the goal of moving the cat. The system will need to be fully functional in an inside environment that will periodically be subject to sunlight in the operational environment. The system must in all stages of use avoid any reasonable amount of harm to all fauna including humans as it will be used inside in an environment where it will come into contact with people and animals it must uphold necessary safety concerns and regulations to not be used as a weapon and abiding by OHS legalities. The cost of the system will need to not go over a $300 budget, the system should be cost-effective utilizing all materials. The system must not produce an unreasonable amount of waste during creation and operation. The standards of quality that the system requires will need to be of a good quality to reflect safety considerations and features as well as the build quality needing to be sturdy and not needing a unnecessary amount of maintenance it will also need to allow for modular integration with other systems and electrical and mechanical components. The styling and appearance of the system’s shape, housing and components will need to be neat and tidy electrically as well as the system itself including its housing not stand out to distract the users and other humans possibly using the operational environment, this includes colors and patterns that may be unattractive or stick out in a room that is constantly utilized. The system will need to have a long durability that does not need to be replaced mechanically or electronically it will also need to perform its required tasks perfectly without error apart from uncontrollable behavior patterns regarding correlated fauna. The system’s main compartment housings will need to be accessible for maintenance purposes of mechanical systems and electrical systems. The system will need to be sized to fit within a 300x300x300mm area. The quality standard of the system will need to be consistent at performing its task of effectively controlling the movement of the cat away from the area. Materials must be accessible and be able to be obtained legally, as well as production methodology only using accessible and safe machines. The solution must be able to obtain a high level of performance where it will be able to detect entities such as the cat and only that specific cat.
